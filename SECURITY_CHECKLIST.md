# Security Checklist: User-Based Data Isolation

This document outlines the security measures implemented and verification steps for the user-based data isolation system.

## ‚úÖ Security Measures Implemented

### 1. Authentication & Authorization
- [x] **JWT Authentication**: All protected routes require valid JWT token
- [x] **HTTP-Only Cookies**: Tokens stored securely in HTTP-only cookies
- [x] **requireAuth Helper**: Centralized authentication validation
- [x] **Role-Based Access**: Different access levels for admin, staff, user

### 2. Data Isolation
- [x] **User-Scoped Queries**: All database queries include ownerId filter
- [x] **Ownership Verification**: verifyOwnership helper for document access
- [x] **Automatic Scoping**: getScopedQuery helper ensures proper filtering
- [x] **No Cross-User Access**: Users cannot access other users' data

### 3. API Security
- [x] **Input Validation**: Proper validation on all endpoints
- [x] **Error Handling**: Secure error messages without data leakage
- [x] **Rate Limiting**: Inherent through authentication requirements
- [x] **CORS Security**: Proper CORS configuration

### 4. Database Security
- [x] **Field Encryption**: Passwords properly hashed with bcryptjs
- [x] **Index Security**: User-based indexes for performance and security
- [x] **Connection Security**: Secure MongoDB connection
- [x] **Data Validation**: Mongoose schema validation

## üîí Security Verification Steps

### 1. Authentication Tests

#### Test 1: Unauthenticated Access
```bash
# Should return 401 Unauthorized
curl -X GET http://localhost:3001/api/patients
curl -X GET http://localhost:3001/api/bookings
curl -X GET http://localhost:3001/api/staff
```

#### Test 2: Invalid Token
```bash
# Should return 401 Unauthorized
curl -X GET http://localhost:3001/api/patients \
  -H "Cookie: auth-token=invalid-token"
```

### 2. Data Isolation Tests

#### Test 3: Cross-User Data Access
1. Login as User A, create some data
2. Login as User B, attempt to access User A's data by ID
3. Should return 404 or 403 (not the actual data)

#### Test 4: API Query Filtering
```bash
# After login, these should only return current user's data
curl -X GET http://localhost:3001/api/patients \
  -H "Cookie: auth-token=valid-token"
```

### 3. Ownership Verification Tests

#### Test 5: Document Access by ID
1. Create booking as User A
2. Login as User B
3. Try to access User A's booking by ID
4. Should fail with appropriate error

#### Test 6: Modification Attempts
1. User A creates patient
2. User B attempts to update/delete patient
3. Should fail with ownership error

## üîê API Endpoint Security Review

### Authentication Endpoints (No auth required)
- `/api/auth/signin` ‚úÖ Secure
- `/api/auth/signup` ‚úÖ Secure
- `/api/auth/signout` ‚úÖ Secure

### Protected Endpoints (Auth + Ownership required)

#### Patients API
- `GET /api/patients` ‚úÖ User-scoped
- `POST /api/patients` ‚úÖ User-scoped creation
- Returns only current user's patients

#### Bookings API
- `GET /api/bookings` ‚úÖ User-scoped
- `POST /api/bookings` ‚úÖ User-scoped creation
- `GET /api/bookings/[id]` ‚úÖ Ownership verified
- `PUT /api/bookings/[id]` ‚úÖ Ownership verified
- `DELETE /api/bookings/[id]` ‚úÖ Ownership verified
- `POST /api/bookings/complete` ‚úÖ Ownership verified

#### Staff API
- `GET /api/staff` ‚úÖ User-scoped
- `POST /api/staff` ‚úÖ User-scoped creation

#### Treatments API
- `GET /api/treatments` ‚úÖ User-scoped
- `POST /api/treatments` ‚úÖ User-scoped creation

#### Withdrawals API
- `GET /api/withdrawal` ‚úÖ User-scoped
- `POST /api/withdrawal` ‚úÖ User-scoped + staff ownership verified
- `PUT /api/withdrawal` ‚úÖ Admin role + ownership verified

### Change Password
- `POST /api/auth/change-password` ‚úÖ User authentication required

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Best Practices Implemented

### 1. Input Validation
```typescript
// Example: Booking creation
const body = await request.json()
// Validate required fields
if (!body.patientId || !body.staffId) {
  return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Required fields missing' }, { status: 400 })
}
```

### 2. Ownership Verification
```typescript
// Example: Before any operation
const user = requireAuth(request)
const document = await Model.findById(id)
if (!verifyOwnership(document, user.userId)) {
  return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Unauthorized' }, { status: 403 })
}
```

### 3. Automatic Data Scoping
```typescript
// Example: All queries automatically scoped
const patients = await Patient.find(getScopedQuery(user.userId))
```

### 4. Error Handling
```typescript
// Secure error responses - no data leakage
catch (error) {
  console.error('Internal error:', error) // Log for debugging
  return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Operation failed' }, { status: 500 })
}
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Considerations

### 1. JWT Token Security
- Tokens stored in HTTP-only cookies (not localStorage)
- Tokens include only necessary user information
- Tokens have appropriate expiration (7 days)

### 2. Database Queries
- All queries include user scoping
- No direct database queries without ownership checks
- Proper error handling prevents information disclosure

### 3. API Response Security
- Error messages don't reveal system internals
- No sensitive data in error responses
- Consistent response formats

### 4. Session Management
- Proper session cleanup on logout
- Token validation on every request
- No persistent sessions without valid tokens

## üîç Manual Testing Checklist

### Pre-Testing Setup
- [ ] Clean database or test environment
- [ ] Two test user accounts created
- [ ] Valid authentication tokens available

### Authentication Tests
- [ ] Cannot access protected endpoints without token
- [ ] Cannot access with invalid/expired token
- [ ] Can access public endpoints (signin/signup)
- [ ] Password change requires current password

### Data Isolation Tests
- [ ] User A cannot see User B's patients
- [ ] User A cannot see User B's bookings
- [ ] User A cannot see User B's staff
- [ ] User A cannot see User B's treatments

### Ownership Tests
- [ ] Cannot modify other user's documents by ID
- [ ] Cannot delete other user's documents by ID
- [ ] Cannot complete other user's bookings
- [ ] Cannot create withdrawals for other user's staff

### Calendar Security
- [ ] Calendar only shows current user's bookings
- [ ] Cannot book appointments with other user's staff
- [ ] Cannot book appointments for other user's patients

## üö® Security Alerts

### Critical Security Rules
1. **Never bypass requireAuth()** in protected endpoints
2. **Always verify ownership** before document operations
3. **Use getScopedQuery()** for all data fetching
4. **Log security violations** for monitoring
5. **Validate all inputs** before processing

### Red Flags to Watch For
- Direct database queries without user scoping
- Missing ownership verification on document operations
- Error messages revealing sensitive information
- API endpoints accessible without authentication
- Cross-user data access in any form

## üìã Post-Deployment Security Checklist

- [ ] All old `/api/[tenant]/` routes removed or disabled
- [ ] Production JWT secrets are unique and secure
- [ ] Database connection uses authentication
- [ ] HTTPS enabled in production
- [ ] Error logging configured for security monitoring
- [ ] Regular security audits scheduled

## üîß Security Monitoring

### Logging
- Authentication failures
- Ownership verification failures
- Unauthorized access attempts
- API errors and exceptions

### Metrics to Monitor
- Failed authentication attempts
- Cross-user access attempts
- API error rates
- Unusual access patterns

This security implementation ensures that users can only access their own data, preventing data leakage and maintaining strict user isolation in the single-user application model.
