## Prerequisites

### Environment Setup
- [ ] `.env` file exists with `MONGO_URI` and `MONGODB_DB_NAME`
- [ ] Node.js v18+ installed
- [ ] Dependencies installed (`npm install`)
- [ ] TypeScript compilation working (`npx tsc --noEmit`)
- [ ] Next.js dev server can start without errors

### Database Access
- [ ] MongoDB Atlas cluster accessible
- [ ] Network access configured (IP whitelist/VPN)
- [ ] Database user has read/write permissions
- [ ] Connection string tested with MongoDB Compass or similar tool

### Code Repository Status
- [ ] Working directory clean or changes committed
- [ ] Latest changes pulled from main branch
- [ ] No merge conflicts

**Validation Command:**

npm run dev
# Should start without errors
```

## MCP Connection Setup

### Note on MCP Implementation
**Current Status:** The application uses direct Mongoose connection via `lib/mongodb.ts`. The term "MCP" in the original prompt likely refers to ensuring secure, cached MongoDB connections through the existing Mongoose pattern rather than implementing a separate MCP (Model Context Protocol) server.

### Connection Configuration
- [x] Connection module exists at `lib/mongodb.ts`
- [x] Uses environment variables (no hardcoded credentials)
- [x] Implements connection caching to prevent hot-reload issues
- [x] Database name configured: `paper-circe`
- [ ] Connection logging implemented (masked credentials)
- [ ] Connection error handling tested

### Connection Validation
- [ ] Test ping to database
  ```bash
  node -e "require('dotenv').config(); const mongoose = require('mongoose'); mongoose.connect(process.env.MONGO_URI, {dbName: 'paper-circe'}).then(() => {console.log('‚úÖ Connected'); process.exit(0)}).catch(e => {console.error('‚ùå Error:', e.message); process.exit(1)})"
  ```
- [ ] List existing collections
- [ ] Verify database name matches `MONGODB_DB_NAME`
- [ ] Test connection in Next.js API route (e.g., `/api/test-env`)

### Security Checklist
- [x] No credentials in git history
- [x] `.env` in `.gitignore`
- [ ] Connection string masked in logs
- [ ] Rate limiting considered for API routes
- [ ] JWT secret properly configured

#### Sample Queries
```javascript
// Check booking conflicts (same staff, overlapping times)
db.bookings.aggregate([
  { $match: { ownerId: "...", status: { $in: ["confirmed", "pending"] } } },
  { $sort: { staffId: 1, startAt: 1 } }
])

// Check patient visit counts
db.bookings.aggregate([
  { $match: { ownerId: "...", status: "completed" } },
  { $group: { _id: "$patientId", count: { $sum: 1 } } }
])

// Check staff balances
db.staff.find({ ownerId: "...", balance: { $lt: 0 } })
```

## Performance & Index Validation

### Query Performance Tests

#### Calendar Query (Most Common)
- [ ] Query: Get all bookings for a specific date and owner
  ```javascript
  db.bookings.find({
    ownerId: "xxx",
    startAt: { $gte: startOfDay, $lte: endOfDay }
  }).explain("executionStats")
  ```
  - **Expected:** Uses index `{ ownerId: 1, startAt: 1 }`
  - **Execution time:** < 50ms for 300 bookings
  - **Documents examined:** ~10-30 (only bookings for that day)

#### Patient Search
- [ ] Query: Search patients by name or phone
  ```javascript
  db.patients.find({
    ownerId: "xxx",
    $or: [
      { name: /search/i },
      { phone: /search/ }
    ]
  }).explain("executionStats")
  ```
  - **Expected:** Uses index `{ ownerId: 1, createdAt: -1 }` then filters
  - **Execution time:** < 100ms for 100 patients
  - **Improvement:** Add text index for better search performance

#### Staff Availability
- [ ] Query: Get staff bookings for a time range
  ```javascript
  db.bookings.find({
    ownerId: "xxx",
    staffId: "yyy",
    startAt: { $gte: checkStart, $lte: checkEnd },
    status: { $in: ["confirmed", "pending"] }
  }).explain("executionStats")
  ```
  - **Expected:** Uses index `{ ownerId: 1, staffId: 1, startAt: 1 }`
  - **Execution time:** < 20ms
  - **Documents examined:** < 10

#### Withdrawal History
- [ ] Query: Get staff withdrawal history
  ```javascript
  db.withdrawals.find({
    ownerId: "xxx",
    staffId: "yyy"
  }).sort({ requestDate: -1 }).explain("executionStats")
  ```
  - **Expected:** Uses index `{ ownerId: 1, staffId: 1 }`
  - **Execution time:** < 30ms
  - **Documents examined:** ~5-20 per staff

### Index Usage Validation
- [ ] Run `db.collection.getIndexes()` for each collection
- [ ] Verify all planned indexes exist
- [ ] Check index sizes: `db.collection.stats()`
- [ ] No unused indexes (check query patterns)

### Load Testing (Optional)
- [ ] Simulate 10 concurrent users
- [ ] Simulate 100 API requests/minute
- [ ] Check response times remain acceptable
- [ ] Monitor MongoDB CPU and memory usage

## Notes & Assumptions

### Implementation Notes

1. **MCP Interpretation:**
   - The application uses standard Mongoose connection pattern with caching
   - Connection is secure and uses environment variables
   - No separate MCP server is needed; the existing architecture is appropriate

2. **Database Structure:**
   - Multi-tenancy implemented via `ownerId` field in all models
   - User isolation enforced at query level (not database level)
   - Single database with logical separation

3. **Seeding Strategy:**
   - Created comprehensive seed script with realistic data
   - Data is deterministic (same seed data each run) for testing consistency
   - Can be run multiple times (clears before seeding)

4. **Index Strategy:**
   - Indexes optimized for most common query patterns
   - Compound indexes for multi-tenant queries (ownerId + other fields)
   - Unique indexes enforce data integrity

5. **Testing Approach:**
   - Manual testing checklist for UAT
   - Automated testing can be added later (Playwright/Cypress)
   - Focus on end-to-end user flows

### Assumptions Made

1. **User Roles:**
   - Current implementation has single role: 'user' (clinic owner)
   - Staff are employees, not login users
   - Future: May need staff login with limited permissions

2. **Payment Processing:**
   - Payment tracking is manual (payment status field)
   - No integration with payment gateways yet
   - Cash/transfer payment methods

3. **Booking Capacity:**
   - Staff capacity allows multiple concurrent bookings (group classes)
   - Default capacity is 1 (individual treatment)
   - Calendar should show multiple bookings per slot if capacity allows

4. **Business Hours:**
   - Default: 09:00 - 21:00
   - No strict enforcement in backend (UI constraint)
   - Future: Add business hours configuration per clinic

5. **Data Retention:**
   - No automatic data cleanup/archiving
   - All historical data retained indefinitely
   - Future: May need archiving strategy for old data

### Known Limitations

1. **Scalability:**
   - Current architecture suitable for small-to-medium clinics (< 50 staff, < 1000 bookings/month)
   - For larger scale, consider sharding or separate databases per tenant

2. **Real-time Updates:**
   - No WebSocket/real-time updates
   - Users must refresh to see changes by others
   - Future: Add socket.io for real-time calendar updates

3. **Search Performance:**
   - Text search without text indexes may be slow for large datasets
   - Consider adding text indexes or external search (Elasticsearch)

4. **Reporting:**
   - Limited reporting features currently
   - Future: Add comprehensive reporting module

5. **Mobile Responsiveness:**
   - UI optimized for desktop
   - Mobile experience may need improvement

### Recommended Next Steps

1. **Short-term:**
   - [ ] Add text indexes for better search performance
   - [ ] Implement automated tests (Playwright)
   - [ ] Add data export functionality (CSV/Excel)
   - [ ] Improve error messages and validation feedback

2. **Medium-term:**
   - [ ] Add comprehensive reporting module
   - [ ] Implement email/SMS notifications for bookings
   - [ ] Add payment gateway integration
   - [ ] Improve mobile responsiveness

3. **Long-term:**
   - [ ] Add real-time updates (WebSocket)
   - [ ] Implement multi-language support
   - [ ] Add advanced analytics and insights
   - [ ] Build mobile app (React Native)
