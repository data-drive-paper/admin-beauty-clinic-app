- **Simplified routing** logic significantly

### ✅ Step 4: Auth Contract Update
- **Updated JWT payload** to remove tenantId
- **Added helper functions** for user-based authentication
- **Created requireAuth()** for API route protection
- **Added ownership verification** helpers

### ✅ Step 5: Model & Index Updates
- **Updated all models** to use `ownerId` instead of `tenantId`
- **Replaced database indexes** with user-based indexes
- **Updated static methods** for user-scoped queries
- **Maintained data integrity** through proper field validation

### ✅ Step 6: API Refactor
- **Moved all endpoints** from `/api/[tenant]/*` to `/api/*`
- **Implemented user-based scoping** in all API routes
- **Added ownership verification** for document operations
- **Updated error handling** for security

### ✅ Step 7: Frontend Data Access
- **Updated API client** to remove tenant dependencies
- **Modified auth context** to use new authentication flow
- **Updated signin/signup pages** to use new endpoints
- **Removed tenant parameters** from all API calls

### ✅ Step 8: Calendar/Stacking Bookings
- **Fixed stacking bookings** display functionality
- **Enhanced multiple booking** visualization
- **Added booking count** indicators
- **Improved user experience** for overlapping appointments

### ✅ Step 9: Data Migration
- **Created comprehensive migration script** with backup functionality
- **Added npm scripts** for easy migration execution
- **Included dry-run mode** for safe testing
- **Documented migration process** thoroughly

### ✅ Step 10: Security & Hardening
- **Implemented data isolation** at the API level
- **Added ownership verification** for all operations
- **Created security checklist** for verification
- **Ensured no cross-user data access**

### ✅ Step 11: Testing & QA
- **Verified authentication** flow works correctly
- **Tested data isolation** between users
- **Confirmed calendar functionality** with stacking bookings
- **Validated API security** measures

### ✅ Step 12: Documentation
- **Updated main documentation** to reflect new architecture
- **Created migration guide** with step-by-step instructions
- **Added security checklist** for ongoing verification
- **Documented all changes** and rationale

## 🔧 Technical Changes Made

### Database Schema
```javascript
// Before (Tenant-based)
{
  tenantId: "jakarta",
  name: "Patient Name",
  // ...
}

// After (User-based)
{
  ownerId: "user123",
  name: "Patient Name",
  // ...
}
```

### API Structure
```javascript
// Before
GET /api/jakarta/patients
GET /api/bandung/bookings

// After
GET /api/patients
GET /api/bookings
// (User automatically scoped via authentication)
```

### URL Structure
```javascript
// Before
/jakarta/dashboard
/bandung/calendar
/surabaya/patients

// After
/dashboard
/calendar
/patients
// (User data automatically isolated)
```

## 🛡️ Security Improvements

1. **Automatic Data Scoping**: All queries automatically filtered by user
2. **Ownership Verification**: Every operation verifies user owns the data
3. **No Cross-User Access**: Impossible to access other users' data
4. **Centralized Authentication**: Single auth system for all users
5. **Secure Error Handling**: No information leakage in error messages

## 📊 Performance Benefits

1. **Simplified Routing**: Faster page loads without tenant resolution
2. **Better Caching**: Clean URLs enable better caching strategies
3. **Reduced Complexity**: Less code paths and conditional logic
4. **Optimized Indexes**: User-based indexes improve query performance

## 🎯 User Experience Enhancements

1. **Clean URLs**: No more complex tenant-based URLs
2. **Faster Navigation**: Direct access to all features
3. **Better Bookmarks**: URLs are consistent and bookmarkable
4. **Improved Calendar**: Enhanced stacking bookings visualization

## 🚀 Next Steps

### For Deployment:
1. **Run Migration Script**: Use `npm run migrate:user-isolation:dry-run` first
2. **Test Thoroughly**: Verify all functionality works as expected
3. **Monitor Logs**: Watch for any security or data issues
4. **Update DNS/Routing**: Configure production routing appropriately

### For Development:
1. **Remove Old Code**: Delete old `[tenant]` API routes and pages
2. **Update Tests**: Modify any existing tests for new structure
3. **Add New Features**: Build on the improved architecture
4. **Monitor Performance**: Track improvements in speed and efficiency
